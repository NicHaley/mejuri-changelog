This is a starter template for [Floe](https://floe.dev).

## Getting Started

> The following assumes you have already created a project in https://app.floe.dev.

#### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm i
```

#### 2. Set environment variables in `.env.local`
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLOE_API_KEY_ID=...
FLOE_API_KEY_SECRET=...
```

#### 3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### 4. (Optional) Configure a data source
This starter template comes with a sample `.floe` directory (in Floe this is known as a 'data source'). To use this data source in your template, you must add it to your project in the [Floe dashboard](https://floe.dev).

Alternatively, you can add `.floe` directory in another repository and set that as your data source instead.
